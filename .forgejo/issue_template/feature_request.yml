        Fuzzel strives to provide a great experience as a simple launcher and switcher,
        while also supporting features that allow users to build more tools based on it. It is
        considered largely feature complete and few features are expected to be added.

        Here's some guidance to clarify what features are of interest and those that aren't.

        ## Not of interest

        - HTML / Pango / Formmating support. Use wofi if you need that.
        - Multi-line support
        - A plugin / extension system
        - More built-in modes like SSH, window switcher, calculator, etc.

        ## Of Possible Interest

        - Implemeting features from similar tools within our scope.

        Features will be more likely to be accepted if similar tools already support the feature.

      placeholder: |
        List similar tools that implement the feature, if any, and
        what syntax they use, if so.  Consider tools like rofi, wofi,
        dmenu and fzf.
